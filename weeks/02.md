* Run through the notebook [./02-dataset.ipynb](./02-dataset.ipynb)
* For more details on uproot and awkard arrays watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlnUF3LRBj4 or run through the SciPy 2020 tutorial: https://github.com/jpivarski-talks/2020-07-13-pyhep2020-tutorial

## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions on Canvas:
* What is a tree?
